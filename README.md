Welcome to the `fastHDMI` repository! This repository contains the source code and results for the `fastHDMI` package, as detailed in the accompanying paper: **"`fastHDMI`: Fast Mutual Information Estimation for High-Dimensional Data"**.

## Package Information

- **Package Manual**: The detailed manual for the `fastHDMI` package is available [here](/fastHDMI/README.md).
- **PyPI Package**: You can find the published package on PyPI [here](https://pypi.org/project/fastHDMI/).

## ABIDE Data Analysis

- **Data**: This repository includes an analysis of the [(pre-processed) ABIDE data](http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/abide/).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The analysis is summarized in [this Jupyter notebook](/paper/ABIDE_data_analysis/ABIDE_analysis.ipynb). Running the notebook will generate the necessary Python and bash scripts to utilize the `fastHDMI` package for data analysis. 
- **Server Execution**: These scripts are configured to run on a server, specifically Compute Canada in this case. After executing the scripts on the server, rerun the Jupyter notebook with the returned data files (e.g., `.npy` files) to produce the plots and results presented in the paper. The output plots are in PDF format.

## Computational Resources

- **Resource Usage**: The `seff-[jobID].out` files provide a summary of the computational resources used for each job, generated by the `seff [jobID]` command. 
- **Compute Canada Documentation**: More information about running jobs on Compute Canada can be found [here](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Running_jobs).
